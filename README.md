Bicycle Power Calculator is a small library (a single function, really) written in TypeScript for calculating required cycling power and other parameters.

The function itself has been ported to TypeScript from HTML/JavaScript version found here: http://www.mne.psu.edu/simpson/courses/me240/bikecalc1.htm (1 June 1999 by John S. Lamancusa - Penn State University (jsl3@psu.edu) )
